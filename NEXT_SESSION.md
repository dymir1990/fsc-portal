## 📋 REMAINING TASKS (For Next Session)

### Priority 4: Upload System Consolidation (30-40 minutes)

**Current State:**
- 5 different upload implementations across the app:
  1. `/case-manager/import` - Case manager CSV upload
  2. `/import` - Alternative import route
  3. Dashboard quick action button
  4. `/billing/my-work` - Provider-specific uploads
  5. `/settings/payers` - Payer configuration uploads

**Tasks:**
1. **Create Unified FileUpload Component** (20 min)
   - Location: `frontend/src/lib/components/FileUpload.svelte`
   - Features needed:
     - Drag & drop zone with visual feedback
     - Click to browse file picker
     - File type validation
     - File size validation (configurable max size)
     - Upload progress bar
     - Error handling with specific messages
     - Success confirmation
     - File preview (filename, size)
     - Cancel upload capability
   - Props:
     - `accept: string` - File types (e.g., ".csv")
     - `maxSize: number` - Max file size in bytes
     - `onUpload: (file: File) => Promise<void>` - Upload handler
     - `label: string` - Button/zone label
     - `description: string` - Helper text

2. **Replace All Upload Implementations** (10 min)
   - Update all 5 locations to use unified component
   - Preserve location-specific validation logic
   - Test each location

**Benefits:**
- Consistent UX across app
- Easier maintenance
- Single source of truth for upload logic
- Reduced code duplication

### Priority 5: Revenue Cycle KPIs (20-30 minutes)

**Metrics to Implement:**

1. **Days in A/R (Accounts Receivable)**
   ```sql
   SELECT AVG(CURRENT_DATE - service_date) as avg_days
   FROM sessions
   WHERE billing_status IN ('submitted', 'pending')
     AND amount_paid IS NULL
   ```
   - Color code: <30 days (green), 30-60 (yellow), >60 (red)
   - Display on dashboard

2. **Clean Claim Rate**
   ```sql
   SELECT
     COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE billing_status = 'paid') * 100.0 /
     NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0) as clean_claim_rate
   FROM sessions
   WHERE billing_status IN ('paid', 'denied')
   ```
   - Target: >95% is excellent
   - Show as percentage with trend

3. **Denial Rate by Payer**
   - Top 10 payers by denial rate
   - Table or chart format
   - Helps identify problematic payers

4. **Average Payment Time**
   ```sql
   SELECT AVG(payment_date - service_date) as avg_payment_days
   FROM sessions
   WHERE payment_date IS NOT NULL
   ```
   - Benchmark: <30 days is good

**Implementation:**
- Extend `/api/metrics/dashboard` endpoint
- Add new section to dashboard page
- Create visualization components (charts or cards)

---

### Priority 6: Basic Reports Page (25-35 minutes)

**Page Location:** `frontend/src/routes/(app)/reports/+page.svelte`

**Report Types to Build:**

1. **Revenue Report**
   - Monthly/quarterly breakdown
   - Billed vs collected comparison
   - By service type, provider, payer
   - Date range selector

2. **Provider Report**
   - Individual performance
   - Session counts and revenue
   - Comparison to team average

3. **Payer Report**
   - Insurance company analysis
   - Payment timing and rates
   - Denial patterns

**Export Functionality:**
- CSV export
- JSON export (for programmatic access)
- Filename includes date and report type
- Respects user permissions

**Backend Endpoint:**
- Create `/api/reports/{report_type}/export`
- Support streaming for large datasets
- Add filters support (date range, providers, payers)

---

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES & TECH DEBT

### Must Fix Soon:
1. **Database Indexes Missing**
   - Add index on `sessions(billing_status)`
   - Add index on `sessions(date_paid)`
   - Add index on `sessions(payer_uuid)`
   - Will improve metrics query performance

2. **No Error Boundaries**
   - Frontend crashes on uncaught errors
   - Need Svelte error boundaries
   - Show friendly error messages

3. **TypeScript Any Types**
   - `user = $state<any>(null)` in Topbar
   - Should be properly typed User interface

### Should Fix Eventually:
1. **No Loading State for Slow Queries**
   - Sessions list could be slow with 1000+ records
   - Add pagination or infinite scroll

2. **Hardcoded User Role Fallback**
   - Falls back to 'billing' on API error
   - Should handle more gracefully

3. **Console.logs in Production**
   - Remove debug logs from layout onMount
   - Add proper logging service

3. **TypeScript Catches Bugs**
   - Spent 0 time debugging null errors
   - Optional chaining + nullish coalescing combo is powerful

4. **Small Commits > Big Commits**
   - Easy to review
   - Easy to revert if needed
   - Clear git history

5. **Self-Review After Each Commit**

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:

- ❌ Don't skip reading documentation
- ❌ Don't guess file locations
- ❌ Don't forget mobile testing
- ❌ Don't skip TypeScript types
- ❌ Don't commit without self-review
