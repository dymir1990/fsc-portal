# üö® URGENT: CSV Import Still Failing - Action Plan

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** CRITICAL - CSV import not working after deployment

---

## üî• Current Issue

### **Problem:**
- CSV uploads successfully (19 rows)
- **0 Records Imported** ‚ùå
- **19 Flagged Rows** ‚ùå
- Sessions don't appear in database

### **What We Tried:**
1. ‚úÖ Fixed backend code (auto-create providers/clients)
2. ‚úÖ Committed and pushed to GitHub
3. ‚úÖ Fixed Vercel build errors
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deployments may not have taken effect**

---

## üéØ Immediate Actions Required

### **OPTION 1: Force Render Redeploy (2 minutes)**

1. **Go to Render Dashboard:**
   - https://dashboard.render.com
   - Find "fsc-portal-backend"

2. **Manually Trigger Deploy:**
   - Click "Manual Deploy" button
   - Select "Clear build cache & deploy"
   - Wait 3-5 minutes

3. **Check Logs:**
   - Click "Logs" tab
   - Look for startup messages
   - Verify no errors

### **OPTION 2: Check Backend is Actually Running (1 minute)**

Test the backend API directly:

```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl https://fsc-portal-backend.onrender.com/health

# Should return: {"ok": true}
```

If this fails, backend isn't running!

### **OPTION 3: Add Debug Logging (5 minutes)**

Add temporary logging to see what's happening:

```python
# In backend/main.py, in the import_simplepractice function:

for i, row in enumerate(reader, start=1):
    total += 1
    try:
        # ADD THIS LINE:
        print(f"Processing row {i}: {row}")
        
        provider_name = pick(row, COLS["provider_name"])
        client_name = pick(row, COLS["client_name"])
        
        # ADD THIS LINE:
        print(f"Provider: {provider_name}, Client: {client_name}")
        
        # Auto-create providers and clients
        prov = find_or_create_provider(provider_name)
        cli = find_or_create_client(client_name)
        
        # ADD THIS LINE:
        print(f"Created/found - Provider ID: {prov}, Client ID: {cli}")
```

Then commit, push, and check Render logs during upload.

## üêõ Additional Issue: "Work on This" Button

### **Problem:**
Button doesn't allow assigning to another person

### **Quick Fix:**

Update the button in the dashboard to include user selection:

```svelte
<!-- In dashboard or wherever the button is -->
<button 
  onclick={() => showAssignModal = true}
  class="rounded-lg bg-blue-600 px-4 py-2 text-white hover:bg-blue-700"
>
  Work on This
</button>

{#if showAssignModal}
  <div class="modal">
    <select bind:value={selectedUser}>
      <option value="">Select User</option>
      {#each users as user}
        <option value={user.id}>{user.name}</option>
      {/each}
    </select>
    <button onclick={assignTask}>Assign</button>
  </div>
{/if}
```

## üîç Diagnostic Steps

### **Step 1: Check What Backend is Running**

```bash
# SSH into Render or check logs
# Look for this on startup:
"Starting application..."
"Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:..."
```

### **Step 2: Check Database Directly**

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check last import
SELECT * FROM import_runs 
ORDER BY started_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;

-- Check if providers were created
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM providers 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

-- Check if clients were created  
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clients 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

-- Check if sessions were created
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sessions 
WHERE imported_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

### **Step 3: Check Flagged Rows**

```sql
SELECT reason, COUNT(*) as count, raw 
FROM import_staging
WHERE run_id = (
  SELECT id FROM import_runs 
  ORDER BY started_at DESC 
  LIMIT 1
)
GROUP BY reason, raw;
```

This will show WHY rows are being flagged!

## üöÄ Most Likely Solutions

### **#1: Render Didn't Actually Deploy**
**Fix:** Manually trigger deployment in Render dashboard

### **#2: Date Format Issue**
**Fix:** Add date conversion (from comprehensive guide)

### **#3: Database Column Missing**
**Fix:** Verify schema has all required columns

### **#4: RLS Policies Blocking Inserts**
**Fix:** Check Supabase RLS policies on tables

---

## ‚ö° Quick Test

Have Mackenzi or you run this test:

1. **Upload a CSV with just 1 row**
2. **Immediately check these:**
   - Import runs table: `SELECT * FROM import_runs ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 1;`
   - Flagged rows: `SELECT * FROM import_staging WHERE run_id = [last_run_id];`
   - Providers: `SELECT * FROM providers ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;`

This will show exactly where it's failing!

## üìû Decision Point

**Choose ONE:**

### **A. Quick Band-Aid (5 minutes):**
- Force Render redeploy
- Add debug logging
- Test with 1-row CSV

### **B. Proper Fix (20 minutes):**
- Implement full guide with:
  - Date conversion
  - UUID-based payers
  - Enhanced logging
  - Better error handling

### **C. Nuclear Option (10 minutes):**
- Revert all changes
- Start fresh with working code
- Apply fixes one at a time with testing

---

## üéØ Recommendation

**IMMEDIATE:** Force Render redeploy + check logs

**IF THAT FAILS:** Implement date conversion from guide

**IF STILL FAILS:** Run diagnostic SQL queries to find root cause

**Next Update Needed:** Results from forced Render deployment
