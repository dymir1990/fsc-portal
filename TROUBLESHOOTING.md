## üî• **Active Issues & Fixes**

### **Issue #1: CSV Upload Shows 0 Imported, All Flagged** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Symptoms:**
- CSV file uploads successfully
- Shows "Upload Complete" message
- Total rows correct (e.g., 19)
- **0 Records Imported**
- **All rows flagged** (e.g., 19 flagged)
- Sessions don't appear in Sessions page

**Root Cause:**
The CSV import required providers (therapists) and clients (patients) to already exist in the database. If they didn't exist, sessions were flagged with reason "missing_provider" or "missing_client" instead of being imported.

**Fix Applied:** ‚úÖ **Oct 21, 2025**
Updated the CSV import to automatically create providers and clients if they don't exist.

**Code Changes:**
- Added `find_or_create_provider()` function
- Added `find_or_create_client()` function  
- Modified import endpoint to use new functions
- Git commit: `9e45582`

**How to Verify Fix:**
1. Wait 5 minutes after deployment
2. Re-upload the same CSV file
3. Should see: **19 Records Imported, 0 Flagged**
4. Sessions appear in Sessions page with correct names

**Deployment:**
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed to production
- **Where:** Render backend (auto-deploy)
- **When:** Oct 21, 2025
- **ETA:** Live within 5 minutes of push
