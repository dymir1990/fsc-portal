2. "Here's our import interface. I'll upload last week's SimplePractice export."
3. Select CSV file
4. Click "Upload & Process"
5. **Pause and explain while uploading:**
   - "The system automatically creates any providers, clients, or insurance payers that don't exist yet"
   - "It also checks for duplicates and flags data issues for review"

6. **Show results:**
   - "As you can see, [X] sessions imported successfully"
   - "Only [X] flagged for manual review - this one has [explain reason]"
   - "The system auto-created the insurance payers we didn't have yet"

## ⚠️ Things to Consider / Potential Issues

### Issue 1: Frontend Still Shows Old UI
**Symptom:** No "Import CSV" button on Revenue page, old sidebar  
**Cause:** Vercel caching  
**Solution:** Use direct URL `app.fscnj.com/case-manager/import` (it works!)  
**For Demo:** Just navigate directly there, don't mention it's a workaround

### Issue 2: Role Shows "Unknown"
**Symptom:** Top-right shows "Unknown" instead of role  
**Cause:** Profile might not exist in database  
**Solution:** Already added fallback to "billing" role  
**For Demo:** After deploy, should show "billing" even if profile missing

### Issue 3: Sessions Show 0 After Import
**Symptom:** Import succeeds but sessions page empty  
**Cause:** Frontend cache or API not responding  
**Solution:** Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) or wait 1 minute  
**For Demo:** Refresh page before starting demo

### Issue 4: One Session Always Flags
**Symptom:** Kelly Bunker row keeps flagging  
**Impact:** THIS IS OK! Shows system is working correctly  
**For Demo:** Use this as a feature - "See how it flags problematic data"
